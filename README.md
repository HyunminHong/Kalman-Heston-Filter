# Kalman-Heston-Filter
Approximate the Heston Model via Kalman-type filtering, assuming linear and Gaussian noise 

TODO: 
* Relax the distributional assumption (currently normal)

The below is the Kalman approximation of the Heston model. Note that the DGP of the Heston model still assumes the normal distributed noise.
